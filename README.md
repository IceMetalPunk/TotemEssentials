# _Totem Essentials_

Totem Essentials is a Minecraft mod that expands on vanilla's "Totem of Undying" with an entire totem crafting system. You reap mobs for their Essence, then use those to craft different types of Totems with different properties.

## Totem Shell
Instead of dropping a Totem of Undying, the Woodland Mansion's Evoker ("Evocation Illager") will now drop a Totem Shell. This is the blank slate, the basis of Totem Essentials, the crafting ingredient you will combine with various Essences to craft your new Totems.

## Essences and Totems
### Reaper Essence / Totem of Reaping
Vindicators ("Vindication Illagers") will naturally drop Reaper Essence 40% of the time. All other Essences must be "reaped"; that is, they must be obtained by killing certain mobs with a Totem of Reaping in your inventory.

A Totem of Reaping is crafted by surrounding a Totem Shell with 8 Reaper Essence. It has 8 durability; whenever you kill a mob that can drop Essence with a Totem of Reaping in your inventory, you've "reaped" that mob. It will drop its Essence and the Totem will take 1 damage. This means each Totem of Reaping lets you reap up to 8 mobs (although it can be enchanted with Unbreaking and Mending to extend its use).

### Vexatious Essence / Totem of Phasing
Vexatious Essence is reaped from, you guessed it, Vexes. If you craft a Totem Shell surrounded by 8 Vexatious Essence, you'll get a Totem of Phasing.

As long as you're holding a Totem of Phasing _in your main hand_, you'll be unaffected by gravity and able to move through solid blocks. You also won't be able to jump, though. Each tick (1/20 of a second) you're inside a solid block, the Totem of Phasing will take 1 damage. Of course, if it breaks while you're inside an opaque block, you'll immediately start suffocating, so be careful!
