# _Totem Essentials_

Totem Essentials is a Minecraft mod that expands on vanilla's "Totem of Undying" with an entire totem crafting system. You reap mobs for their Essence, then use those to craft different types of Totems with different properties.

## Totem Shell
Instead of dropping a Totem of Undying, the Woodland Mansion's Evoker ("Evocation Illager") will now drop a Totem Shell. This is the blank slate, the basis of Totem Essentials, the crafting ingredient you will combine with various Essences to craft your new Totems.

## Essences and Totems
### Reaper Essence / Totem of Reaping
Vindicators ("Vindication Illagers") will naturally drop Reaper Essence 40% of the time. All other Essences must be "reaped"; that is, they must be obtained by killing certain mobs with a Totem of Reaping in your inventory.

A Totem of Reaping is crafted by surrounding a Totem Shell with 8 Reaper Essence. It has 8 durability; whenever you kill a mob that can drop Essence with a Totem of Reaping in your inventory, you've "reaped" that mob. It will drop its Essence and the Totem will take 1 damage. This means each Totem of Reaping lets you reap up to 8 mobs (although it can be enchanted with Unbreaking and Mending to extend its use).

Reaped mobs will drop 1 Essence, plus 1 extra Essence for each level of Looting your weapon has. No matter your level of looting or the number of Essence dropped, the Totem will always take only 1 damage per mob reaped.

### Vexatious Essence / Totem of Phasing
Vexatious Essence is reaped from, you guessed it, Vexes. If you craft a Totem Shell surrounded by 8 Vexatious Essence, you'll get a Totem of Phasing.

As long as you're holding a Totem of Phasing _in your main hand_, you'll be unaffected by gravity and able to move through solid blocks. You also won't be able to jump, though. Each tick (1/20 of a second) you're inside a solid block, the Totem of Phasing will take 1 damage. Of course, if it breaks while you're inside an opaque block, you'll immediately start suffocating, so be careful!

### Lactic Essence / Totem of Curing
If you milk a cow, you get milk. If you reap a cow, you get Lactic Essence. Craft 8 Lactic Essence around a Totem Shell to make a Totem of Curing.

If you would receive a negative potion effect with a Totem of Curing in your inventory, it'll be cured immediately. Doing so does damage the Totem, though, at a rate of 1 damage per effect cleared per level. So removing a Wither I effect would cost 1 damage, but removing Poison II would cost 2 damage; and removing them both would cost a total of 3 damage.

The Totem of Curing has 10 durability, by the way. That's probably important to know.

### Featherfoot Essence / Totem of Featherfoot
Chickens float, so why can't you? What if I told you that you could?

Then I'd be lying. You can't float, but if you reap enough chickens for 8 Featherfoot Essence, you can craft up a Totem of Featherfoot. As long as this is in your inventory, it'll absorb all fall damage you would otherwise take, until it breaks.

It's like Feather Fallling on steroids, if it took up an extra inventory slot...

### Vampiric Essence / Totem of Vampirism
Bats. They are completely useless, right? Nope! Reap them for their Vampiric Essence, which you can use to craft a Totem of Vampirism.

Whenever you deal damage to a mob while you have a Totem of Vampirism in your inventory, you'll heal equal to the amount of damage you dealt. Healing this way deals the same amount of damage, rounded up, to the totem.

### Traveling Essence / Totem of Traveling
Ender pearls are great, but they can only take you so far. Skip to the next level of teleportation by reaping enough Endermen of their Traveling Essence to make a Totem of Traveling!

Sneak + Use the Totem of Traveling to bind it to your current coordinates. After that, you can simply use it normally to teleport back to that spot from anywhere in the world. Note that you can't teleport cross-dimensionally; but you can see what coordinates and dimension the Totem is bound to in its mouse-over tooltip.

It takes 1 damage per use, plus 1 damage for every 10 blocks you travel. If it doesn't have enough durability left to make the full trip, you will teleport somewhere between your current location and your destination... better hope it's not in lava!
